# Join Us
We invite you to be a part of our team!

We are not demanding and believe that every skill, no matter how small, counts.

The only, but important requirement is to have experience in any of the following fields:

1. **Game Development.** It's highly recommended to have previous experience with any 3D game engine, such as Roblox Studio, Unity 3D, Godot, among others (this includes map creation, basic knowledge of 3D modeling, programming, or other related fields). ðŸ”¨
2. **Programming.** If coding is your thing, you'll fit right into our team! You just need experience in a high-level programming language like Python or Javascript (or Lua ðŸ‘€) and a basic understanding of object-oriented programming (OOP). ðŸ’»
3. **Music Production.** If you have already created music, this won't be challenging for you, especially if you specialize in musical ambiance or sound effects creation. Get ready to produce as many "bang, bang" sounds as you can. ðŸ”«
4. **3D Modeling.** Do you have experience with programs like Blender 3D or Cinema 4D? You're in. If you can create 3D models with great efficiency, we're interested on having you on our team. ðŸŒŸ

Even if you don't meet one of these requirements, tell us what you can do. There are many things that were not mentioned specifically, but they are so specific that it's not worth creating their own category.
